    <h2>Well, there are lots of ways we can work together!</h2>
    <p>Find the fit for you</p>
    <h3>The free initial consultation.</h3>
    <p>
      It all starts here! We'll hop on Skype or phone for 30 minutes to chat about what's going on in your life. I'd love to hear about your health challenges and background to know what we're dealing with here. I'll give you more information about my 6-month program and answer any questions you may have. This is a great first step towards a healthier you! Just fill out the form below and I'll get back to you about setting that call up.

    <h2>YES, PLEASE!</h2>
    <h3>The 6-month program</h3>
    <p>
      Here's where things get good. In this program, we'll work one-on-one to sort through your goals and implement them in small and manageable ways. We'll have a 50 minute chat, every other week for 6 months. Our meetings will take place via phone, Skype, or in person if you live in the Nashville area. We'll cover all areas of health - food, relationships, career, spirituality, and self-care. I'll provide you with tips, recipes, information, articles, books, and most importantly - a listening ear. I'll be there to help you navigate all the conflicting health information floating around, find a way of living that works for you, and hold you accountable to the goals you want to achieve. At the end of our time together, you'll have healthy habits that will stay with you for the rest of your life. If you're ready to start feeling better, then let's work together!

    <h2>LET'S DO THIS</h2>
    <h3>The overpacker</h3>
    <p>
      I'm the kind of girl who travels with the largest suitcase I can get away with. And I've been known to fill it with some "weird" things - a plethora of tea, magnesium powder, lemons... heck, I'd pack my Vitamix if I could! But alas, this isn't always realistic. So I've become a healthy travel expert. I've tracked down the Italian B&B that serves farm to table aperitivo, the health food market in small town Indiana, and every conceivable yoga class I could squeeze in during SXSW in Austin. Are you traveling and hoping to not feel like crap after eating terribly the whole time? Maybe you're a touring musician who can't stomach another Taco Bell stop on the road. I'll do all the research and hook you up with the restaurants that have gluten-free options for you, the spin classes you could hit between meetings, and the itinerary to fit it all in. And don't worry - I won't skip the stuff the city is famous for. You gotta have some fun too! Let me plan your healthy trip so you can relax or get down to business without worrying about your next meal/workout!

    <h3>The group program</h3>
    <p>
      Some of us like learning from a group of our peers - if this is you, maybe a group program is the right choice! This is similar to a 6-month program, but instead of the one-on-one attention, we'll work through health challenges as a group. I'm currently developing several group programs with a specific health focus.
