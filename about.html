    <h1>Hi there! I'm so happy you're here. Let's get you feeling your best, shall we?</h1>

    <h2>What is health coaching?</h2>
<p>
  I had never heard of health coaching... until I needed one myself. I had been to so. many. doctors. There was the doctor who told me to take fiber supplements to help my daily stomach aches. The endoscopy report that came back normal. The internist who put me on an acid reflux prescription. And still, I felt like crap. Now, this is not to say that doctors aren't helpful - I discovered my gluten allergy because of one kind doctor's intuition. But sometimes, a lot of times, we need guidance on our health journey. Not just a periodical check-in.
</p>
<p>
  When I started seeing a health coach, I felt like finally someone really wanted to help me get to the bottom of things. I showed up at her doorstep with 27 food intolerances, a bad sleep schedule, and work stress that wouldn't quit. Instead of giving me a pill to try to solve one specific thing, I was encouraged to evaluate all areas of my life that could be affecting my health. And with my health coach's support, I was able to implement changes that made me feel like myself again. I loved that health coaching provided me a safe environment to explore what was impacting my health, and also the guidance and support to make changes that fit into my lifestyle. I loved this experience so much that I decided to become a health coach myself!
</p>


<h2>My philosophy</h2>
<p>
  I grew up in Michigan, went to school in LA at USC, and then spent several years in Brooklyn before settling in Nashville. I've lived the crazy city life with dinner at midnight in the back of a cab. I also treasure my midwestern roots and love the slower pace of southern living. My goal is to help you live the life you dream of, whatever that may be, while feeling like the healthiest and happiest version of yourself.
</p>
<p>
  I trained in holistic nutrition at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition - a school that focuses on balancing food, relationships, career, spirituality, and self-care rather than depending on an outdated food pyramid. I studied with Andrew Weil, Deepak Chopra, Mark Bittman, Geneen Roth, David Katz, Mark Hyman, and Gabrielle Bernstein, among others. I've learned about every dietary theory under the sun - paleo, vegan/vegetarian, raw, ayurvedic, sugar-free, grain-free. You name it, I've studied it. And while there are definite proven benefits to some of those ways of living, I believe that what works for one person, may not work for another. I will help you find that right combination of what works for you. Making sure that you're getting exactly what you need from your diet and all other areas of your life.
</p>

<h2>How I can help you</h2>
<p>
  Do you feel like you wake up in the morning, hit the snooze, and promise yourself that you'll go running tomorrow? Are you crazy busy at work and feel like you barely get to see your friends? Are you checking email in bed before you go to sleep and scrolling Facebook on your phone first thing in the morning? And do you eat a protein bar at your desk, thankful that you've had time to eat at all? I've got solutions for you, my friend. And they don't include becoming a crossfit freak who only drinks beet juice and swears off social media forever. I know you have a life and I'll help you find healthy ways of living that fit for you.
</p>
<p>
  When we work together one-on-one, we'll have sessions every other week to chat about what's going on for you. We'll celebrate your successes and discuss any challenges, planning out ways to make them easier to handle moving forward. I'll provide you with tips for healthy living, product recommendations, articles that will support you, recipes that don't take an hour to prepare, even books you may enjoy. I'm also available between sessions for an encouraging email or to answer that emergency question on your mind (What are all these different kinds of kale? Are chia seeds supposed to get slimy? Am I doing this meditation thing right???) Together, we will work out a strategy that is doable and that you feel good about implementing. Over time, these small changes will become lifelong habits.
</p>

<h2>My specialties</h2>
<h3>Food Intolerances</h3>
<p>
  I can help you figure out what is making you feel bloated/tired/sick. Once we pinpoint the culprit, I'll help you focus on what you can eat instead of mourning what you can't.
</p>

<h3>Gluten/Dairy-free</h3>
<p>
  I have a ton of personal experience with the two most common food intolerances. I have recipes, restaurant ideas and strategies to help you barely miss the bread and cheese!
</p>

<h3>Stress Management</h3>
<p>
  We'll find ways to decrease your stress without losing your edge at work. It may seem like stress is a way of life, but I promise you there's a way to excel without burning out.
</p>

<h3>Sleep</h3>
<p>
  So many people sleep poorly these days! I'll help you get on a sleep schedule that leaves you feeling well rested and energized.
</p>

<h3>Healthy Food Swaps</h3>
<p>
  We'll discuss small ways to incorporate healthier items into your daily diet to eat cleaner and feel better. I have lots of tips on how to drink more water, eat more greens, and avoid processed foods!
</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>
  I'll help you implement a workout plan that fits with your personality, preferences, and schedule. Hate yoga? All good. Love swimming? Let's get you in the water, stat!
</p>

<h3>Big Dietary Changes</h3>
<p>
  If you're ready to make a big change, I am here to support you. Whether it's cutting back on sugar (or ditching it altogether!), eating less meat, drinking less alcohol, or switching to a clean foods diet - I've done it myself and would love to help you make the transition as well!
</p>

<h3>Hormones</h3>
<p>
  If you suspect that your hormones are causing problems for you, there are lots of things we can do with diet, supplements, and lifestyle changes to help balance them out.
</p>

<h3>Self-Care</h3>
<p>
  It is so important to make time in your life to take care of yourself! We're all guilty of being a slave to our to-do list instead of making time for the things that replenish us. I'll help you turn that around.
</p>

<h3>Spirituality</h3>
<p>
  Spirituality doesn't necessarily mean religion and will look different for each of us. One thing that can help us feel more connected, regardless of our spiritual views, is meditation. And it's not just for monks these days - CEOs and business leaders now swear by it! It can be very challenging to develop a practice, but I have some tricks up my sleeve to get you started and stick with it.
